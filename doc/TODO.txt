- distinguish whether someone was an admin in the space or not

- you can fetch the stuff that was posted in the jumbotron

TODO apiv2-tombstones
- on Tweet Detail:
  - tombstones in replies to the focused tweet
- on User Feed:
  - tombstones (e.g, "Age restricted") that show up as top-level entries
    - keep in mind that these might be retweets; the entry-id is the RetweetID, not the TweetID

TODO: fatih-color

TODO: mobile-requests
- implement mobile versions of various requests
- Check in `pkg/scraper/test_responses/mobile_requests`

TODO: search-bottom-cursor
- Entry type "TimelineReplaceEntries" that replaces the cursor in the timeline instead of the new timeline having a new one
- As first step, need helper function that returns the []Instruction element in a APIV2Response (not just the MainInstruction which is TimelineAddEntries)
	- since different requests have different paths to the Instructions, e.g., Data.User.Result.Timeline.Timeline.Instructions vs Data.Home.HomeTimelineUrt.Instructions, etc
