TODO: get-user-tweets-user-not-in-database (#scraper)
- subcommand `get_user_tweets` should fetch the user first instead of just failing

TODO: bash-completions

TODO: twitter-spaces-add-is-details-available-flag (#scraper, #spaces)

TODO: scrape-media-tab (#scraper)

TODO: scrape-quote-tweets (#scraper)

TODO post-tweets
- post tweets
  - reply to a tweet
  - quote-tweet a tweet
- retweet a tweet

TODO spaces-fetch-participants-info (#scraper)
- some user information is available in a Spaces result.  Right now we just render them as null users (handle = "", id = 0) if they're not fetched already
- distinguish whether someone was an admin in the space or not

TODO spaces-fetch-sharings (#scraper, #spaces)
- you can fetch the stuff that was posted in the jumbotron

- https://twitter.com/exit_org/status/1656813511572443141

TODO authenticated-only-request-warning
- warn when attempting to run requests which require authentication without a session active
  - right now it will try and then produce an HTTP error (404)

TODO unknown-user-upgrading
- if an unknown user (created to satisfy SQLite integrity check on user_id foreign key) has user details fetched, the "Join Date" and other zero-value fields should update with the new value

TODO apiv2-tombstones (#scraper)
- on Tweet Detail:
  - tombstones in replies to the focused tweet
- on User Feed:
  - tombstones (e.g, "Age restricted") that show up as top-level entries
    - keep in mind that these might be retweets; the entry-id is the RetweetID, not the TweetID

TODO: tidy-up-command-line-flags
- make flags that are part of a subcommand go after that subcommand (e.g., `twitter get_user_tweets -n 200 ...`)

TODO: mobile-requests
- implement mobile versions of various requests
- Check in `pkg/scraper/test_responses/mobile_requests`

TODO: search-bottom-cursor
- Entry type "TimelineReplaceEntries" that replaces the cursor in the timeline instead of the new timeline having a new one
- As first step, need helper function that returns the []Instruction element in a APIV2Response (not just the MainInstruction which is TimelineAddEntries)
	- since different requests have different paths to the Instructions, e.g., Data.User.Result.Timeline.Timeline.Instructions vs Data.Home.HomeTimelineUrt.Instructions, etc

TODO: compound-query-structs (#webserver)
- Right now the result structs for the compound queries (e.g., "Feed", "TweetDetail") are in the `persistence` package.  They don't go there probably

TODO: login-routes-tests (#webserver)
- Make the scraper.API object injectable somehow (get rid of singleton pattern) and add tests for login and change-session sequences
- Also test profile.ListSessions()

TODO: non-htmx-500-errors (#webserver)
- non-HTMX 500 errors show a weird HTML page

TODO: refactor-compound_queries_test-file (#webserver)
- Move the tests for user feeds into the compound_queries_ssf_test file

TODO: incomplete-threads (#webserver)
- when previous tweet in thread is missing, put a "fetch tweet" button to get it

TODO: dms-search (#webserver, #dms)

TODO: search-terms-highlighted (#webserver)

TODO: send-message-last-read-event (#webserver)
- When a user sends a message, their last-read-event should be updated to that message ID immediately (no few-second delay in UI)

TODO: emoji-rewrite (#webserver)
- get rid of the "database.js" stuff in the emoji picker
  - remove whatever uses `crypto.subtle` to load the emoji list

TODO: windows-session-list (#release, #windows)
- Check that sessions load as @Offline_Twatter instead of @test\Offline_Twatter on Windows
