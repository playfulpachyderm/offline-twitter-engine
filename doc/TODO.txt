TODO consecutive-tombstones
Conversation threads with two or more consecutive tombstones don't get scraped correctly

Video size reduction:
- add "bitrate" and "available bitrates" fields
- option to upgrade or downgrade video quality

TODO tombstone updating:
- "Tweet is unavailable" tombstones are not always accurate.  In user feed, they show as "not available" but the real reason is "deleted" etc; should update the tombstone type when fetching the conversation view
- tweet-to-stub: If a tweet is deleted after getting a non-stub version, should still show a tombstone (or a modified one at least)
- stub-to-tweet: If a user un-privates after getting a stub-version (or tweet becomes available for other reasons), stub versions should write the real content and "stub" status should be removed
