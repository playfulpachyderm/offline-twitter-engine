Make sure this download is correct.  One time I downloaded it and it was corrupted, and apk-mitm failed to unzip it

Disable CA Certificate pinning using apk-mitm: https://github.com/shroudedcode/apk-mitm

Install android studio
Make a Android Virtual Device (AVD); I used version 33 with a Pixel 7
Install the patched APK on the AVD (I put it on blog.wispem-wantex.xyz/twitter.apk and downloaded it in the AVD with Google Chrome)

Install mitmproxy
Follow instructions to install mitmproxy certificate as a system CA cert: https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/#instructions-when-using-magisk
Use the settings button (in the floating sidebar) on AVD to set up proxy settings to use host machine's IP and port 8080

Start `mitmweb` (mitmproxy web UI) without args (not transparent mode)
Restart AVD using `emulator -writable-system ...`, otherwise it will load a clean system without the CA cert installed

Start twitter on the AVD and it should proxy to mitmweb!
