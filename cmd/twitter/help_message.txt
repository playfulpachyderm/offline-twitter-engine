Usage: twitter [--profile <profile_dir>] [<flags>] <operation> <TARGET>
This application downloads tweets from twitter and saves them in a SQLite database.

<profile_dir>:
    Optional.  Indicates the path to the directory containing the data directories, database files, and settings files.
    By default, will use the current working directory.
    Ignored if <operation> is "create_profile".

<operation>:
    create_profile
          <TARGET> is the directory to create.  It must not exist already.
          <profile_dir> will be ignored if provided.

    fetch_user
    download_user_content
          <TARGET> is the user handle.
          "download_user_content" will save a local copy of the user's banner and profile images.

    fetch_tweet
    fetch_tweet_only
          <TARGET> is either the full URL of the tweet, or its ID.
          If using "fetch_tweet_only", then only that specific tweet will be saved.  "fetch_tweet" will save the whole
          thread including replies.

    download_tweet_content
          <TARGET> is either the full URL of the tweet, or its ID.
          Downloads videos and images embedded in the tweet.

    get_user_tweets
    get_user_tweets_all
          <TARGET> is the user handle.
          Gets the most recent ~50 tweets.
          If "get_user_tweets_all" is used, gets up to ~3200 tweets (API limit).

    follow
    unfollow
          <TARGET> is the user handle

    list_followed
          No <TARGET> is needed; will be ignored if given.
          Lists all the users (by their @handle) that are followed.

    search
          <TARGET> is the search query.  Should be wrapped in quotes if it has spaces.

<flags>:
    -h, --help
          Print this message, then exit.

    -v, --version
          Print the version number and exit.

    -n, --number
          Set the number of tweets to fetch, when getting a feed.  Default is 50.
          Setting this flag means you will get at least that many "tweets plus retweets" from that user (unless of
          course they don't have that many).  The total amount of tweets returned will be larger, because quoted tweets
          won't count toward the limit.
